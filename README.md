Key Skills: Medical device design, research, Solidworks (3D modelling)

## Abstract
The reality of the commercially available
prostheses lies in that they are expensive, highly complex to use
and maintain. These factors hinder their full utilisation and
hinder the competence in both perspectives of the robot
prostheses and their end user. In order to increase the utility in
everyday life tasks, simpler grippers are of less burden to the
users in terms of cost and usability. The objective of this project
is to design a non-anthropomorphic gripper that is capable of
demonstrating adaptive behaviour compliance, as well as
increased accessibility to the users. The fabrication process
followed a Hybrid Deposition Manufacturing (HDM) technique,
where material deposition and embedded components are
combined to produce multi-material parts. The designed models
were prototyped using an Ultimaker 3D printer in which the
urethane and silicon were deposited. The experimental
validation proved that the gripper was capable of successfully
grasping the drill, chain, wrench, fork, hammer, card and
washer. The gripper was able to lift a 1.5L water bottle
vertically, but could not withhold alternate orientation. The
proposed gripper could be used as affordable prostheses with
some improvements in the assembly methods.

An adaptive, non-anthropomorphic prosthetic gripper has
been designed with regards to usability in everyday life. The
objective is to demonstrate adaptive behaviour, compliance,
low cost, light-weight, ease of maintenance through
approachable fabrication.
